I am graduating from [Nanyang Technology University(NTU), Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and getting my Msc. degree in Computer Control and Automation in Feb, 2022. Before that, I received my B.Eng in Automation from [Hefei University of Technology(HFUT), China](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in Jun, 2020. Previously, I tried to explore many fields and conducted a preliminary look, such as {% post_link teleoperated-car-based-on-EEG Electroencephalography(EEG) interaction %}, {% post_link hexapod-robot hexopod robot%}, computer vision and {% post_link deep-reinforcement-learning reinforcement learning %}. Recently, I am doing research on the filed of Human-Robot-Interaction(HRI) based on manipulator. And now I am finding a Research Assistant or PhD position. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me.
**Research interests**: computer vision, machine learning and human robot interaction.
